# UtransVox Project APP Development

## Technologies:

- **React Native:** Using React Native to develop cross-platform mobile applications, we have achieved a consistent user experience on iOS and Android platforms. React Native allows us to build native applications using JavaScript, which speeds up development and improves application performance.
- **Websocket:** Using Websocket to implement real-time communication functions in the translation APP. This is particularly important in functions that require fast and real-time feedback, such as simultaneous interpretation, which ensures the instant transmission and processing of voice and text data.
- **Java Native Module:** In the React Native development of the translation APP, I used the Java native module to implement advanced custom functions. These functions enhance the user experience and operational flexibility of the APP.
- **Fully use Typescript:** Typescript is used for the overall development of the project, which improves the readability and maintainability of the code, and reduces runtime errors.
- **React Native File Library Application:** Using React Native's file processing library, the file viewing, saving and generation functions are implemented. This includes the operation of PDF and TXT format files, especially the generation of translation result files.
- **Google Authorization Login:** Integrated Google Authorization Login, providing a secure and convenient login option, enhancing the user experience.
- **Real-time voice processing:** Use react-native-audio and react-native-audio-record to process real-time voice. This includes the processing of voice fragments and the transfer of audio data to the back end for processing.
- **File upload:** Use XMLHttpRequest to process file upload, including the display of upload progress, which is particularly important for users to upload audio files and documents.
- **React Navigation:** Use React Navigation to handle the routing requirements of the APP in the project. This library makes navigation between different screens and views smooth and easy to manage.
- **Context Provider:** Use React's Context Provider to manage and pass device data and user authorization information. This method makes cross-component data sharing more efficient and direct.
- **Use reduce to process data:** In the process of real-time voice translation, use the reduce function to effectively process and distribute dynamic data. This method allows the incoming data stream to be accumulated and processed to ensure the order and integrity of the data.
- **AppState listening:** Use the addEventListener function in the AppState module of React Native to listen to the user's application usage status. This allows the APP to detect and respond to whether the user is currently using the APP or whether the APP is running in the background.

## Personal Contribution:

- **Light and dark theme settings:** Developed a function that allows users to switch between light and dark themes according to personal preferences. This not only improves the visual experience, but also meets the user's personalized needs.
- **Chinese and English language system settings**: Implemented a bilingual system setting of Chinese and English, which allows the APP to automatically switch the interface language according to the user's language preferences.
- **Personalized startup page:** Developed a dynamically changing startup page based on theme and language settings to display different content. This enhances the professionalism of the APP and the user's first impression.
- **APP behavior control before startup:** Implemented the function of controlling its behavior before the APP is fully started, ensuring a smoother and more stable startup process.
- **User agreement pop-up window:** Added a pop-up window for users to agree to the agreement when the APP is launched for the first time, ensuring the transparency of legal and privacy policies and meeting compliance requirements.
- **Typescript integration:** Integrate Typescript into the React Native environment to improve development efficiency and code quality.
- **Startup page and user agreement logic:** Developed the logic of dynamic startup page and user agreement pop-up window using the strong typing feature of Typescript, which enhances the robustness of the code.
- **Behavior control and error handling:** In the behavior control and error handling before the APP starts, advanced features of Typescript such as enumeration and interface are used to improve the reliability and clarity of the code.
- **File viewing:** Developed the file viewing function, which allows users to view files stored on the device directly in the APP.
- **File saving:** Implemented the file saving function, which allows users to save the translation results on the device for easy reference and use in the future.
- **Translation result file generation:** Specially developed the function of generating PDF and TXT format translation result files, which allows users to choose different file formats according to their needs.
- **User experience optimization:** Ensure the smoothness and user-friendliness of file operations, and improve the user experience in processing translation documents.
- **Google login integration:** Implemented the Google authorization login function, which increases the security and accessibility of the APP.
  Real-time voice fragmentation and transmission: Developed the function of real-time voice fragmentation, and realized the effective transmission of fragmented audio data to the back end
- **File upload progress management:** Implemented the function of file upload using XMLHttpRequest, and added progress tracking, which allows users to understand the upload status in real time.
- **Routing management:** Implemented routing management based on React Navigation to ensure that the navigation logic within the APP is clear and user-friendly.
- **Data sharing and management:** Through Context Provider, the device data and user authorization information are centrally managed, which improves the efficiency and consistency of data processing.
- **User authorization processing:** Pay special attention to the security and accurate management of user authorization information, ensuring the security of the APP and user privacy.
- **Integration of interface and logic:** Ensure that the routing logic is smoothly integrated with the overall interface and functions of the APP, and improve the user experience.
- **Dynamic data management:** Implemented dynamic data processing logic based on reduce to ensure the accuracy and consistency of data during real-time processing.
- **Status update problem solving:** Use reduce to solve the problem of incorrect order of status update logic, which is crucial for maintaining the consistency and accuracy of application status.
- **Performance optimization:** Ensure the high performance and response speed of the real-time voice translation function, and reduce the delay by optimizing the data processing logic.
- **Enhance user experience:** Through smooth and accurate real-time voice translation, improve user experience and satisfaction.
- **Payment order processing:** Use user application status information to optimize the processing logic of payment orders. For example, when the user switches to other applications or screens during the payment process, the application can pause or save the payment status, which increases the security and convenience of the operation.
- **User behavior statistics:** Use application status data to more accurately count user behavior. This includes tracking the user's activity time and frequency in the APP, thereby providing more accurate user behavior analysis data.
- **Enhance user experience:** Through this status monitoring, the user experience is improved, especially in maintaining data security and processing interrupted operations.
- **Data security and integrity:** Ensure that the data is protected in different application states of the user, especially when processing sensitive payment information.
