I am a full-stack engineer with a strong passion for front-end development. 🌟 I noticed that our technical stacks are very compatible, which makes me excited 😊 about the possibility of collaborating with you.

Currently, I am dedicated to improving my English language skills 📚 and am eager to work in an English-speaking environment to further develop my capabilities. I believe that supporting your projects will not only provide me with valuable technical experience but also enhance my language proficiency. 🗣️

After a lengthy and challenging search for remote opportunities, I've come to recognize areas where I need to grow, both in my technical skills and in English communication. 🤔 This realization has motivated me to start as an assistant, as I believe this role will provide me with the ideal environment to sharpen these skills and contribute meaningfully. 💪

I am seeking an opportunity to work as an assistant, aiming to learn more about front-end development and apply my knowledge as a full-stack developer in practice. I am confident that my contribution to your projects will be valuable, not only in the tasks you assign but also in any area where my skills can add value. This could include collaborating on new initiatives, bringing fresh perspectives to existing challenges, or simply supporting the team wherever needed. 🚀
